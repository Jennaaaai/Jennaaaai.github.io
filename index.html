        welcome to my porfolio!
          Hello, My name is Jenny. I am a high school stundent in San Francisco. 
            I am looking forward to learning more about coding. 
             I have a cat, named Meowgi.
              Currently I am reading a very interesting book called "Memoirs of a Geisha"
             I enjoy traveling and taking landscape photographs.
            One day I hope to become an air traffic controller.
          I am very creative but I am not artistic.
        When I am interested in something, I get very determined to learn or solve it
